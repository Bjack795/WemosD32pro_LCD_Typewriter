## Software
All the libraries and files included in TYPEWRITER folder.

Arduino IDE must be used to upload all these files.

**REMEMBER**

Add the Wemos D32 pro from the Board Manager

### WebServer Rights

All the WebServer functions rights belong to G6EJD (https://github.com/G6EJD), a genius to whom goes my gratitude for the help given to this project.

## Still a prototype
This is the actual aspect of the project.

In the future the aim is to convert it to Epaper display.
The keyboard will be an assembled mechanical one and the case will be 3d Printed
